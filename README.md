Check the bot here [@appointvix](https://t.me/VixineBot).

A Telegram bot to

- Monitor multiple Zip-Codes for slots availability.
- Get an notification alert as soon as the slots become available.


## Note

On 6th May 2021, CoWin API added caching and rate limits. The public API data would be cached upto 30 minutes, so the alerts wouldn't be so instant in busy areas, which reduced this bot's functionality to being a nice UI for public CoWin site in Telegram.
